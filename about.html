<h3> Why do we need it? </h3>
<p><b>
We know that these days good Programming Skills are a necessity. Everyone wants to be a great programmer. But in doing so, a student faces a lot of problems.

So, for a newbie, it becomes difficult to refer to different websites, or consult different books for getting the basic programming help and clear his/her doubts.
Many times its not possible for the student to consult his/her teacher for all the doubts and queries. A solution to this issue can be a platform, for the students of the University, by the students of the University itself. So, in order to resolve this issue, <b style="font-family:Supercell;">CODERS CLAN</b> was created.

Coders Clan is a forum-like Online Discussion Platform designed for the students of our university, Chitkara University.

This Online Programming Problems Discussion Platform Project is a web application which has two panels, an administrator panel and a user panel, which will be accessible by students and even teachers. In this forum, users and administrator will discuss on technical questions related to programming languages. Moreover, students will be provided with information according to the curriculum of the University. If the student uses other Internet sites or other sources to gather information regarding programming, it may be possible that he/she comes across some extra information which may be irrelevant or confusing for him/her and maybe, it does not even solve the purpose. Students & teachers can register with the application and post questions related to programming or answer the ones' already posted by others. In this way, students can satisfy their needs of getting information related to various programming languages from a single source.
